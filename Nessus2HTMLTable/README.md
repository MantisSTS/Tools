# Nessus2HTMLTable

## Description
I doubt this script will be useful to many other people but it will take a .nessus file and convert it to a HTML table which can then be copied into a report. This only works with compliance issues.

## Install 

`go build .`

## Usage

Once built you can just run it like this:

`./Nessus2HTMLTable -i PentestProject.nessus > table.html`
